&lt;p&gt;This week's featured word is квітень, because I was too impatient to wait until November. Квітень (pronounced &lt;em&gt;kvee-teyn&lt;/em&gt;) is the Ukrainian name for the month of April. In Russian, the names of the months sound familiar: January is январь (&lt;em&gt;yan-var&lt;/em&gt;), April is апрель (&lt;em&gt;ap-ryel&lt;/em&gt;), and October is октябрь (&lt;em&gt;ok-tya-br&lt;/em&gt;). But in Ukrainian, the names of the months are totally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first learning the months of the year in Ukrainian, this unfamiliarity upset me. "Ukrainian months are so confusing!" I exclaimed in frustration to my partner, a native speaker of both Russian and Ukrainian. "On the contrary," she countered, "Ukrainian months are much easier to remember." What I didn't realize at the time was that the names of the months in Ukrainian are related to the time of year and human interactions with nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, квітень is derived from квітка, the Ukrainian word for flower. Similarly, травень, the Ukrainian word for May, is derived from трава, the word for grass. Other favorites include лютий (February) meaning harsh, червень (June) which could refer either to scale insects (червець) or the color red (червоний), and жовтень (October) from the color yellow (жовтий). But best of all is листопад (November) meaning the falling of leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently on a plane for the first time in a while. When clouds obscured the landscape below, I decided to engage with the screen in front of me. Prompted to choose a language I opted for one I don't know all that well (as has been my habit) — this time I chose Russian. True to form, I quickly decided I was lost and scrambled to switch back into English. However, instead of giving up altogether, I spent a little time memorizing the screen and then switched back into Russian. Using my newfound knowledge of the screen layout, I was able to navigate to the in-flight map and explore the now-foreign landscape of the Western United States. I tested my reading skills with the transliterations of Salt Lake City (Солт-Лейк-Сити), Ogden (Огден), and Provo (Прово), but had to supress a laugh when I reached Tooele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="In-flight map of Northern Utah" src="https://yvanhuele.github.io/images/wow/tooele.jpg" style="max-width:90%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defiantly Unphonetic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tooele is the name of a city, county, and a valley in Northern Utah. The spelling is treacherous: Upon hearing the name &lt;em&gt;Tooele&lt;/em&gt; spoken out loud, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was spelled &lt;em&gt;Tuwilla&lt;/em&gt; instead. To add insult to injury, it &lt;a href="http://www.co.tooele.ut.us/clerk/information/tooele.pdf"&gt;seems the original spelling was Tuilla&lt;/a&gt;. Having tricked many people before, the unphonetic spelling certainly confused the Russian-language in-flight map, which offered the following transliteration: Тооел.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words with double o's are rare in Russian, but there are a few examples such as сообщение (message) and зоопарк (zoo). Using the pronunciation of these words as a guide, it would follow that Тооел should be pronounced &lt;em&gt;tah-ah-el&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;tah-ah-yel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russian Clash with the West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being confused by Tooele is an understandable mistake. However, the in-flight map commits a more serious transgression by failing to be self-consistent. Indeed, just north of Тооел, we find the transliterations of West Jordan and West Valley City. These are rendered as Уэст-Джордан (&lt;em&gt;Oo-est Djor-dan&lt;/em&gt;) and Вест-Вэлли-Сити (&lt;em&gt;Vest-Veh-lee See-tee&lt;/em&gt;), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the in-flight map is paying homage to &lt;a href="https://nameberry.com/blog/mormon-baby-names-traditions-and-trends"&gt;Utah's love of unconventional spellings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Russian"></category><category term="Cyrillic"></category><category term="Utah"></category><category term="fluff"></category></entry><entry><title>Догадок</title><link href="https://yvanhuele.github.io/dogadok.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-15T21:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-03-15T21:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Yannick</name></author><id>tag:yvanhuele.github.io,2018-03-15:/dogadok.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Some Guesswork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we'll look at the Russian word &lt;em&gt;догадок&lt;/em&gt; (transliteration &lt;em&gt;dogadok&lt;/em&gt;), which, in the context we're interested in, means &lt;em&gt;conjectures&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;guesswork&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;This week, we'll look at the Russian word &lt;em&gt;догадок&lt;/em&gt; (transliteration &lt;em&gt;dogadok&lt;/em&gt;), which, in the context we're interested in, means &lt;em&gt;conjectures&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;guesswork&lt;/em&gt;. Our focus is really on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension"&gt;declension&lt;/a&gt; of догадок (genitive plural) rather than its meaning: any Russian noun would do, but I chose that one because this post is based on a guess or  conjecture — or possibly just an inkling. Here is the (not very precise) conjecture: the declension of Russian nouns after numbers is related to the fact that the variance scales with the mean in count distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Count Distributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard McElreath brings up the relationship between the variance and the mean of a count distribution when introducing count models in his Winter 2015 &lt;a href="http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/"&gt;Statistical Rethinking&lt;/a&gt; lectures. He also describes how this relationship is reflected in human languages. The discussion relevant to this post begins &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrchZeyo7cg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1h7m10s"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and continues for just over a minute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"This is a very important thing about count variables. All count distributions are like this: the variance inflates with the mean. And that's true in nature as well: the bigger the magnitude of a count the more uncertainty there is around the mean and that's a normal thing about counts. This is actually kind of embedded intuitively in the inate human counting system which is logarithmic [...] it's present in all human languages: one, few, many. Right, that's logarithmic because it's magnitudes and people intuitively — even if they're not numerate beyond one, few, many — understand that many is vaguer than few and few is vaguer than one, so the precision goes down as [the mean] goes up as well."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Numbers and Declension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remark about one, few, and many got me thinking about &lt;a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Russian/Numbers#Use_of_numerals_in_context"&gt;declension of nouns after numbers&lt;/a&gt; in Russian. The rules can get somewhat complex so I want to focus on the simplest example: counting objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Basic Rule&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with the following rule which is not quite correct and refine it later: &lt;em&gt;When there is exactly one of an object, use the nominative singular. When there are two, three, or four of an object, use the genitive singular. When there are five or more, use the genitive plural.&lt;/em&gt; (Note that we have different cases for one, few, and many.) For example, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;одна догадка (one guess, nominative singular)&lt;br /&gt;
две догадки (two guesses, genitive singular)&lt;br /&gt;
пять догадок (five guesses, genitive plural)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One guess, two guesses, five guesses" is a faithful translation, but if we were to try and force the grammar upon the English translation, it might take the form of "one guess, two [instances] of guess, five [instances] of guesses." It may help to see how the nominative and genitive cases are used in another context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Эта догадка такая же хорошая, как и любая другая. (This guess is as good as any other.)&lt;br /&gt;
Причина этой догадки неизвестна. (The reason for this conjecture is unknown.)&lt;br /&gt;
Случайность этих догадок поражает. (The randomness of these guesses is astounding.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the form of the number preceding the noun and the &lt;a href="http://www.russianlessons.net/grammar/nouns_genitive.php"&gt;noun-ending&lt;/a&gt; itself depend on the gender of the noun, but the pattern of nominative singular, genitive singular, genitive plural is followed across all genders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;один суп (one soup)&lt;br /&gt;
два супа (two soups)&lt;br /&gt;
пять супов (five soups)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;одна ворона (one crow)&lt;br /&gt;
две вороны (two crows)&lt;br /&gt;
пять ворон (five crows)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;одно слово (one word)&lt;br /&gt;
два слова (two words)&lt;br /&gt;
пять слов (five words)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Catch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so good, we seem to have different rules for one, few (two, three, four), and many (five or more). However, rule described above only works as long as the objects number twenty or fewer. As soon as we hit twenty-one, we start over. Numbers ending in one (but not in eleven) take us back to the nominative singular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;одна догадка (one guess)&lt;br /&gt;
двадцать одна догадка (twenty-one guesses)&lt;br /&gt;
сто девяносто одна догадка (one hundred ninety-one guesses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, numbers ending in two, three, or four (but not in twelve, thirteen, or fourteen) are followed by nouns in the genitive singular. For all others, we're back at the genitive plural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that we know the full rule, is the conjecture still valid? Your guess is as good as mine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Russian"></category><category term="grammar"></category></entry><entry><title>Ворона</title><link href="https://yvanhuele.github.io/vorona.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-08T13:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-08T13:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Yannick</name></author><id>tag:yvanhuele.github.io,2018-03-08:/vorona.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, our featured word is ворона, or maybe it's собака, or maybe it's корова, or maybe it's all three.

&lt;p&gt;They figure in a short Soviet claymation film, Пластилиновая ворона (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticine_Crow"&gt;Plasticine Crow&lt;/a&gt;), based on Aesop's fable about the fox and the crow. The narrator is uncertain about the details of the story so we are presented with multiple possiblities from the time of day, to the size of the cheese, to the identities of the main characters. Is it a crow or perhaps a dog or a cow? Is it a fox or is it instead a janitor/street-sweeper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is available &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WVb_MKlsi1s"&gt;here on youtube&lt;/a&gt; and an English translation can be found &lt;a href="http://lyricstranslate.com/ru/mozhet-buit-vorona-%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%B1%D1%8B%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0-and-probably-crow.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em style="font-size:90%"&gt;может быть ворона, а может быть собака, а может быть корова/ maybe a crow, or maybe a dog, or maybe a cow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me as a language learner, the cartoon strikes a good balance between structure and whimsy. You often get similar concepts together: the cheese might have been 200 grams, 300 grams, or half a kilo and might have been denstined for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Presented together the relationships between these concepts are reinforced. 
On the other hand, the story sometimes takes you by surprise and introduces you to phrases you probably wouldn't encounter in other contexts: The fox might be an evil ostrich! And the moral of the story — not to horse around on construction sites — is an interesting alternative to the one presented in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Fontaine%27s_Fables"&gt;La Fontaine's version&lt;/a&gt; about the perils of being taken in by flattery. La Fontaine's version can be found translated into English &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JW5bAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Fables%20%20Denis&amp;amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or set to music and performed live by Les Frères Jacques &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/d6Xp_uzxpeQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Though, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Crow_(Aesop)#The_story"&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt; La Fontaine's moral was not always viewed as sufficiently moralizing by some who were scandalized that the fox was allowed to make off with his ill-gotten cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="stylized cat" src="https://yvanhuele.github.io/images/wow/koshka.png" style="max-width:30%" /&gt;

I found the sound of the word amusing and wanted to feature it for that reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just going to leave it at that when I began to wonder about the word &lt;em&gt;winkel&lt;/em&gt;: The Ducth word for shop didn't seem to match any word for shop that I knew in other languages. To be fair, unlike the word market (Dutch: &lt;em&gt;markt&lt;/em&gt;; German: &lt;em&gt;Markt&lt;/em&gt;; French: &lt;em&gt;marché&lt;/em&gt;; Spanish: &lt;em&gt;mercado&lt;/em&gt;), the words for shop or store seem to vary a lot by language (German: &lt;em&gt;Geschäft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Laden&lt;/em&gt;; French: &lt;em&gt;magazin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;boutique&lt;/em&gt;; Spanish: &lt;em&gt;tienda&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper, I learned that winkel &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/winkel#Etymology"&gt;once meant corner&lt;/a&gt;. Had I done any mathematics in German, I might have known that &lt;em&gt;Winkel&lt;/em&gt; is the German word for angle. Anyways, it seems that corner turned into corner store, then into store and lost its original meaning of corner (&lt;em&gt;hoek&lt;/em&gt; in modern Dutch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Periwinkle Periwinkles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winkel shares a common root with the English words &lt;em&gt;winch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wink&lt;/em&gt;.  These words also share a common root with one type of &lt;em&gt;periwinkle&lt;/em&gt;, but not with its homonym. We can split periwinkles into two categories: in one category is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_periwinkle"&gt;type of snail&lt;/a&gt; and in the other is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinca"&gt;type of flower&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periwinkle_(color)"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt; matching that of the flower. The snail is &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/periwinkle#Etymology_2"&gt;related&lt;/a&gt; to winking, but the flower &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/periwinkle#Etymology_1"&gt;is not&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Dutch"></category><category term="etymology"></category></entry><entry><title>Суп</title><link href="https://yvanhuele.github.io/sup.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-18T17:30:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-02-18T17:30:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Yannick</name></author><id>tag:yvanhuele.github.io,2018-02-18:/sup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Big Cottonwood Soup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I experienced a bit of reverse culture shock. This was all the more surprising given that I had neither left my original cultural environment nor spent any significant amount of time emerged in the culture I had seemingly adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was waiting for the ski bus and looking over the posted schedule.  After checking the return times, my eyes were drawn to the route map. Upon reading the labels &lt;em&gt;Big Cottonwood Cyn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Little Cottonwood Cyn&lt;/em&gt;, I did a double-take:  It took me a full ten seconds to realize that &lt;em&gt;cyn&lt;/em&gt; is the (English) abbreviation for canyon rather than &lt;em&gt;суп&lt;/em&gt;, the Russian word for soup. With italics, they're indistinguishable, so here they are again without emphasis: cyn vs суп. Despite the small difference, having once misread the sign, I cannot unsee the soup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cyn abbreviations in UTA ski bus map and Russian Wikipedia article on суп" src="https://yvanhuele.github.io/images/wow/cyn.png" style="max-width:90%" /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Opposite Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is the first time I've accidentally mistaken the Latin alphabet for Cyrillic, the opposite problem — reading Cyrillic characters as Latin ones — was very common when I first started learning Russian and Ukrainian and is a problem that continues to haunt me.  Many &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabets#Common_letters"&gt;Cyrillic letters&lt;/a&gt; look the same as Latin letters but are pronounced differently. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;В/в sounds like V/v&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Н/н sounds like N/n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Р/р sounds like R/r&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more infamous examples is &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pectopah"&gt;ресторан&lt;/a&gt; (restaurant, transliteration: &lt;em&gt;restoran&lt;/em&gt;), but others include север (north, transliteration: &lt;em&gt;sever&lt;/em&gt;), верх (up, transliteration: &lt;em&gt;verkh&lt;/em&gt;), and of course the СССР (USSR, which is surprisingly close to the transliteration: &lt;em&gt;SSSR&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Russian"></category><category term="Cyrillic"></category></entry></feed>
