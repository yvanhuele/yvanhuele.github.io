<p>This week's word is the Dutch <em>winkelwagen</em>: <em>winkel</em> means shop or store, <em>wagen</em> means cart or car, and together they form a shopping cart. I found the sound of the word amusing and wanted to feature it for that reason alone.</p>
<p>I was just going to leave it at that when I began to wonder about the word <em>winkel</em>: The Ducth word for shop didn't seem to match any word for shop that I knew in other languages. To be fair, unlike the word market (Dutch: <em>markt</em>; German: <em>Markt</em>; French: <em>marché</em>; Spanish: <em>mercado</em>), the words for shop or store seem to vary a lot by language (German: <em>Geschäft</em>, <em>Laden</em>; French: <em>magazin</em>, <em>boutique</em>; Spanish: <em>tienda</em>).</p>
<p>Digging deeper, I learned that winkel <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/winkel#Etymology">once meant corner</a>. Had I done any mathematics in German, I might have known that <em>Winkel</em> is the German word for angle. Anyways, it seems that corner turned into corner store, then into store and lost its original meaning of corner (<em>hoek</em> in modern Dutch).</p>
<h2>Periwinkle Periwinkles</h2>
<p>Winkel shares a common root with the English words <em>winch</em> and <em>wink</em>.  These words also share a common root with one type of <em>periwinkle</em>, but not with its homonym. We can split periwinkles into two categories: in one category is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_periwinkle">type of snail</a> and in the other is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinca">type of flower</a> along with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periwinkle_(color)">color</a> matching that of the flower. The snail is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/periwinkle#Etymology_2">related</a> to winking, but the flower <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/periwinkle#Etymology_1">is not</a>.</p>                </article>

<p>K-means clustering is a well-known algorithm for which there already exist many good online resources. My first introduction to K-means (as was the case with many other machine learning techniques) was from the textbook <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><em>Introduction to Statistical Learning</em></a>. However, a recent experience caused me to …</p>
