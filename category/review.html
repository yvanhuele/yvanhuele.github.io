<p>$K$-means clustering is a well-known algorithm for which there already exist many good online resources. My first introduction to $K$-means (as was the case with many other machine learning techniques) was from the textbook <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><em>Introduction to Statistical Learning</em></a>. However, a recent experience caused me to revisit this algorithm. After discussing $K$-means with someone who held some misconceptions about the algorithm, I decided to dig deeper into some of the details. Though I doubt those misconceptions are widely held, I wanted to address a few of them. Looking more closely at the algorithm, I learned a few new things as well -- in particular, the different initialization techniques. Instead of focusing on a few isolated aspects of $K$-means, it seemed more natural to wrap them together into a general discussion of the algorithm. And that's how another review of $K$-means clustering was born.  I wish I could say that I'm presenting $K$-means from an exciting new point of view that will completely redefine the way you think about the algorithm. But the truth is I mostly just had fun making some plots and wanted to share the results.</p>
<p>I decided to split the discussion into several posts. In this first post, we'll talk about why one might use $K$-means clustering, discuss how to choose the number of clusters, and then give a brief overview of the algorithm. In the second part, we'll discuss different initalization techniques and the importance of running the algorithm several times with different random initializations. Then, in a third post, we'll look a little more closely at the math behind $K$-means and look at some data that causes trouble for $K$-means.</p>
<p>The code used to generate the figures can be found here.</p>                </article>
